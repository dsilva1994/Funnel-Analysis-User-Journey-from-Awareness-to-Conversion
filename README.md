# **E-commerce Sales Funnel Analysis**

## **Project Summary**  

This project investigates an online sales funnel to identify potential reasons for declining conversions. The goal is to pinpoint where and why users drop off in the purchase process, enabling strategic improvements. The analysis focuses on answering the following key questions:  

### **Key Questions:**  
1. **How does the number of users change from the first stage of the funnel to the last per country and device category?**  
2. **What is the conversion rate from the initial stage to the final stage of the funnel per country and device category?**  

### **Methods:**  
Since this is the first attempt at mapping the user journey, I selected events that align with the classic marketing funnel—awareness, interest, desire, intent, and conversion. These are represented by:  
- **Page View →** Awareness  
- **View Item →** Interest  
- **Add to Cart →** Desire  
- **Begin Checkout →** Intent  
- **Purchase →** Conversion  

**Data Source:** Internal data from the Data Analytics program institution.
